### Things can improve
1. URL route for each game, so that user doesn't need to input contract address for join, solve and timeout.
2. Overall structure of the app, I didn't pay attention to the contract, initially I thought it is one contract to handle all games.
3. A webserver for storing all the created games address.
4. A proper logging system with the game results, players address.
